I can go OUT OF MY WAY to listen to some of the most OBSCURE shit imaginable made by artists NEVER haerd of by ANY MUSIC LOVING NORMIE out there.. And about what genres I listen to.... I can listen to some funky beats or relaxing ambient shit, that most people can consider to be pleasing to their ears, then I can listen to metal type music without going MAD.. And THEN there are times where my brain goes.. 'HAHA loud breakcore/jungle/hardcore/digital hardcore music go BBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR' and still be fine even thought i went through a BRAINROT. If you really want to see what type of music I like to listen to then go ahead and check out my highlights known as 'Music' and 'Music 2' or something like that and witness the madness yourself...",

  "The most defining characteristic of breakcore is the drum work, which is often based on the manipulation of the Amen break and other classic jungle and hip-hop breaks, at high BPM. The techniques applied to achieve this differs from musician to musician, some preferring to cut up and rearrange the breaks, while others merely distort and loop breaks or apply various effects such as delay and chorus to alter the break's timbre.\n\nMelodically, there is nothing that defines breakcore clearly. Classic rave sounds such as acid bass lines, Hoovers, and Reese bass are common, but breakcore is mostly known for sampling sounds from all over the musical spectrum to accommodate the frantic and fast-paced nature of the rhythm section. Around the turn of the century, more and more breakcore musicians began employing traditional synthesis techniques to compose elaborate melodies and harmonies. There are a growing number of musicians who make use of recorded live instrumentation in their music. These musicians include Istari Lasterfahrer, Hecate, Benn Jordan, Ruby My Dear, QÃ¼atros, Venetian Snares, and Igorrr.",

  "this is why I can't take any esoteric music genre seriously, especially breakcore. Every single song is called 'alone.' or 'IHATE MYSELF HAHAHHAHAHA' by an indie artist called 'j e nnie .' with drum beats that sound like the audio equivalent of a stale cookie left outside the box for 1 hour, a quirky, vaguely perceptible melody with slight pitch shifting to sound 'unsettling', and zero musical progression or pattern. when I search BREAKCORE expect something like INTO THE FIRE or YOUR BEST NIGHTMARE, not Everywhere At the End of Time with a garageband tap drum sample and 2x speed. when listen to breakcore I expect adrenaline to be pumping fast, as if 50 cops are chasing me in the Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005) by Black Box Games, an EA Games Studio Burger King Heat 7 Challenge. do NOT expect to hear the audio equivalent of the Solaris Purple tile wallpaper. DO BETTERA",
